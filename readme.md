# juice. Coding Challenge

The goal of this challenge is to test your abilities in a fullstack environment
This challenge is an iterative project that you can keep building on and can also use as a portfolio piece as a display of your own work.

In this project, you will likely use Node, Mongo and Express and Angular.

## Brief

Create a simple recommendation system of any kind. (We would love to get a pizza recommendation!)

You will start off by creating a function that just gives you the recommendation and eventually build on top of that to create a backend route that a client can call to reeceive this recommendation. You will then store this in a database, after which you will build a frontend for a user to recieve this recommendation using the backend service.

### Details
Here are the highlights of what we'd like to see built out for this project.
This is not an exhaustive list but we recommend following these steps in this order and getting to as far as you can within the given time period.
As always, you can keep iterating on this project as you see necessary.

### Recommendation System
Your first step in this project will be to build a function that gives you a recommendation
You will build a simple recommendation system which will consists of two input params and a recommendation based on those inputs.

```
input 1 + input 2 = recommendation
```

You will use two different lists to create these inputs, ideally about 5 items per list, giving you about 25 different recommendation combinations.

### API Route
Your next step is to create an API route that will take in these inputs from a client and send back a recommendation.

### Database
In this step, you will create a database schema for MongoDB to store the inputs and recommendation
For future iterations, you can actually integrate it with a local instance of Mongo.

### Frontend
Here you can get creative and make a frontend that a user can actually interact with to select inputs and get a recommendation.
We would love to see this in Angular, but any frontend framework is fine.
You can either create a separate repository or two different folders for the client and server applications

### Nice to haves
We would prefer that you work with Typescript and create interfaces/types as and when necessary
Use Classes to help you build out each of the modules

## What we're looking for
 - Good, clean code that is readable by any developer.
 - Consistent commit history to track changes.
 - Creativity on the frontend
